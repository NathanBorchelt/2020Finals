1. The Projects
  * **M1adlib & SciFi Combined** -- This is **NOT** tested, but sould work in theory.
  * **GDRitzy's** -- I did all the back end coding, with all the objects, but I am unsure of how everything transitions or if information truly worked, could not test.
  * **Guess Who** -- I did not use inheritance, but it should be working, atleast it was when I was testing it
  * **Password Manager** -- I did alot of the actuall managing, not fully confident how well it saves, and it is not very user friendly, but it should work
